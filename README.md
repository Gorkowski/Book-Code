# Book-Code
This github repository (https://github.com/aerosol-modelling/Book-Code) contains the code and exercises from the associated book "Introduction to Aerosol Modelling: From Theory to Code", edited by David Topping and Michael Bane (Wiley 2022). The book is available in print and electronic forms, with discussions and instructions relating to the code and exercises. 

The files here include examples, exercises and solutions from each chapter. All codes discussed in a chapter, along with those required to undertake each exercise and to implement the suggested solution are given in a directory relating to that chapter.
